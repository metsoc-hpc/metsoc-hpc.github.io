        The workshop on recent trends toward digital twins of the Earth will be held online on <b>Thursday, August 18th, 2022</b>.<br>
        If you wish to attend, please register <a href="https://forms.gle/xt8mrNLvyX1oCUta6"><u>HERE</u></a> in advance.<br>
        <b>Deadline of registration: August 15th, 17:00JST</b>

        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
	  Against the backdrop of recent advances in computational science, observation technology, and computer performance, as well as the promotion of the Green Deal, a very large project to construct a digital earth is underway mainly in Europe and the United States. This trend has been recognized in Japan as well. Although each project is developing its own elemental technologies, there is currently little interaction across projects. In this meeting, we will focus on data platforms, interfaces with society, and model development, which are important components of digital twins of the earth, and share related domestic and international trends with the weather and climate community. We will review the history of the project and freely discuss future directions, aiming to serve as a springboard for future collaboration.
